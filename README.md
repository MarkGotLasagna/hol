## What is HOLP
__History Of Linux Project__ (HOLP) is an open-source, collaborative effort, and to be 
[cultural association](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associazionismo_culturale), aimed at illustrating the 
history of Linux by using a timeline with colorful cards and images. Each card in the diagram 
represents a core event in history that contributed to the creation of Linux and to what Linux 
is, today. Images placed above the timeline illustrate important figures, 
logos belonging to either companies or organizations that helped directly or passively with the 
creation of Linux.

## Goals

2. Preserve the history of the Linux kernel's development.
3. Be an academic defacto for teaching Linux's history.
