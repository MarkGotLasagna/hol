            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>History Of Linux Project</strong> (HOLP) is an open-source initiative dedicated to 
                illustrating the rich history of Linux through an interactive timeline with colorful cards and images.
            </p>
            
            <h3>What is HOLP?</h3>
            <p>
                Each card in our diagram represents a core event in history that contributed to the creation of Linux 
                and what Linux is today. Images placed above the timeline illustrate important figures, logos belonging 
                to companies or organizations that helped directly or passively with the creation of Linux.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Our Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Illustrate how Linux came to be, from its birth till present day</li>
                <li>Preserve the history of the Linux kernel's development</li>
                <li>Be an academic resource for teaching Linux's history</li>
                <li>Raise awareness of the open-source initiative</li>
